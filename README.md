# Prediction of Movie Ratings Among Young Adults Using Linear Regression and Deep Learning

The goal of this project is to investigate the features of movies published since the year 2000 that lead to higher ratings among adults between the ages of 18 and 30. [Linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) and [deep neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) models are applied on the publicly available [IMDb movie dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset).

The code used to analyze the dataset is available in the Jupyter Notebook, and a PDF report explaining the project in more detail is also available in this GitHub repository. This is my final project for [18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/).
